# Room booker

The idea for this room booker demo came up while I was working on another Alexa Skill. I was wondering how this 
[Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/de/lex/). 

## What this demo consists of? 

* A Lex Bot asking the user for reservation details like
  * the building to book a room in
  * the date and time
  * the reservation length
  * necessity of a video conference system. 

* A [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/de/lambda/) function that processes the information and sents it as e-mail.
Ideally the Lambda would interface with a real room reservation system, but I do not have any access to one.


## What has Slack to do with this?
TODO
